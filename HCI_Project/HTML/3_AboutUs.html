                        MTgraphy was founded by Kholid Septiceye and Raffles Andi in 2007 after finishing their college as a design students. Dissatisfied with the current existing "Old-Fashioned" photography services, Kholid and Ambi decided to start a photography service selling company that's always up to date. At the time Kholid started to build the business model and website using an open-source web application framework. Meanwhile, Ambi was focused on increasing his photography skills and taking samples to display on their platform. They launched their business as MTgraphy in march 2007.</p>
